## Commits Made Today

### 2. `658cf2b` - Add custom CSS tooltips for key UI elements

---

## Features Implemented

### Follow-up Question System
- Added `askFollowup()` function to show follow-up input
- Added `buildFollowupContext()` to build rich context from previous debate results
- Added `submitFollowup()` to submit follow-up with context pre-populated
- Context includes: original question, AI positions, key arguments, consensus result

### Bug Fixes
- **Post-debate UI visibility**: Fixed issue where tactical drawer and timeline scrubber remained visible after closing verdict modal
- **Followup section reset**: Added reset code to `newDebate()` and `showVerdict()` functions
- **closeVerdict()**: Now properly calls `hidePostDebateUI()` to clean up UI state

### Custom CSS Tooltips
- Replaced native browser `title` tooltips with custom CSS tooltips
- Features:
  - Instant appearance on hover (no delay)
  - Arrow pointer for professional look
  - Slide-in animation
  - Glassmorphic dark theme
  - Position variants (top, bottom, left)
- Elements with tooltips:
  - Devil's Advocate toggle
  - Context toggle button
  - AI nodes (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok)
  - Bias badge
  - Usage indicator
